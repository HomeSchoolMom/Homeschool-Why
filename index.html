        <h1>Homeschool - You Can Do It</h1>

<p>We started our homeschool experience in 2017. At the time we had 3 kids at home. Our oldest, 8 at the time, had been in public school since Kindergarten. He had attention problems and was always up and about in the classroom. He was disruptive to the class. So our journey began.</p>

<p>You can do this. Take a deep breath, look at your child and know you got this!</p>

          <h2>"Why We Began."</h2>


<p>At the end of the third grade we were called in for a meeting with the principal. This is where all mine and my husband's conversations on homeschool had started to become reality. We sat there listening to the principal tell us about OUR child and how WE had failed him. My husband and I knew we must take our child's future into our own hands.</p>

<p>We were informed by the principal that it may be time to start our son on medication to control his behavior. Where at this time we had complied with all the suggestions of the school counselor, the principal, the teachers, everyone but ourselves. My husband and I are both in the medical field and knew the effects that medication would have. </p>

<p>The principal reported (Now take this into consideration) our son was not aggressive or disrespectful to any of the staff or his peers. He was, however, disruptive to the class. He would talk to his classmates, play, make sounds, and move chairs during class time. According to the principal and his teacher his behavior had gotten to the point that he and his desk had been moved to the hallway outside the classroom. We were floored to learn that the school had taken such measures without notifying us.</p>

<p>We sat there and listened to how we, as parents had failed him. And in the same breath she praised her staff for the patience they had demonstrated. I must have missed something.</p>

<p>We left school that day feeling as though in some way we had failed as his parents, that we hadn't done enough. We discussed options but we always came back to the same conclusion, we DID NOT want our child medicated for being an 8 year old little boy. If he had aggressive tendencies we would have been open to medication but there were none. We bounced ideas back and forth but medication was an absolute "NO". </p>


          <h3>"The Beginnings."</h3>

</div><!--closes man thinking-->
<p>We decided public school was no longer an option. So therein lies our dilemma, "Where do we start?" </p>

<p>My husband and I both worked full time jobs. How were we going to homeschool a child? By God's grace, he worked Monday thru Friday and I worked Saturday and Sunday. But even though our work schedules were ideal neither of us knew the "how" of homeschooling. So research here we came.</p>


            <h4>"Our First Endeavor"</h4>

<p>Virtual.. What in the world was virtual school? We had started our research and virtual seemed to be everywhere. We dove in. We must have researched every virtual academy that ever existed. Internet searches, social media, parent comments, questions asked by email, internet, and calls. It sounded like our prayers had been answered.</p>

<p>After 2 months of completing forms, phone calls, emails, and faxes he was enrolled. School started, he was excited, we were extremely anxious. Was this the answer we had been praying and searching for?</p>

<p>4 months in. After LONG days, a lot of tears, and a lot of frustration we decided this was not the answer we had hoped for. We were crushed. So we pulled our hearts out of the pits of our stomach and started over.</p>

             <h5>"Starting Over, Again"</h5>

<p>We knew I would be the main person to teach our son. But could I do it? Did I have what it took to be our son's parent, teacher, mentor all in one? But how could I, a nurse not a teacher, teach a child what he needed to know to grow up to be a responsible, prosperous adult? All the "how's, what if's, could I's" overwhelmed me. There were a lot of tears shed, a lot of sleepless nights, A LOT of anxiety but we pushed onward.</p>

<p>We took some time off. Not only for me but for him. All the stress we were feeling, he was feeling as well. After a few weeks we decided we would take it slow. During our break I researched a lot of curriculum but there was one that I kept coming back to. It was the first curriculum that came up in my general internet search. I looked it over but it seemed too easy. So I passed it by and continued to push forward. After another month or 4 and several tries with different curriculum we were back at the beginning again. What was I going to do? Summer break was approaching. So I decided I would delve in and find the perfect conclusion to our what seemed neverending dilemma. </p>

               <h6>"Our Prayers Answered"</h6>

<p>Over the summer I really dove into researching curriculum to find OUR perfect match. That first curriculum kept popping up in every search. So I decided I would finally listen to what was being told to me. That I would finally accept the answer that I had prayed for. I opened up that first curriculum and read and read some more. How did I ever pass this up? This was it! This was what I had been searching for.</p>
